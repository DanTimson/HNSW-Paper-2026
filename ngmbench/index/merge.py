"""Divide-and-conquer construction by pairwise merge.

Leaves are HNSWs built on partitions. Internal nodes merge two child indices
with one of NGM / IGTM / CGTM. The driver supports two merge orders:

  sequential : (((p0 . p1) . p2) . p3)  — left fold
  balanced   : ((p0 . p1) . (p2 . p3))  — binary tree (parallelizable)

For each pairwise merge we relabel B's ids to [nA, nA+nB) so the combined local
id-space is contiguous from zero; this is required for CGTM and harmless for the
others. The merged index's global_ids is the concatenation of the children's.
